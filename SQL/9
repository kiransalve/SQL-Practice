Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).



Question

Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 
ON DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = w2.recordDate
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;


we use self-join (Weather w1 JOIN Weather w2) to compare each day's temperature 
with the previous day's temperature.

The ON condition DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = w2.recordDate ensures that 
we compare each recordDate with the one exactly one day before.


The WHERE condition w1.temperature > w2.temperature filters out 
records where the temperature is higher than the previous day.

We select only w1.id as the output.
