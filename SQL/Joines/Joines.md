**Joines**

Joins in SQL are used to combine data from two or more tables using a common column.

Simple meaning - When data is split into different tables, JOIN helps you see it together.

Why joins are needed - 

Example:

One table has customer details

Another table has orders

To see who ordered what, we use JOIN.
